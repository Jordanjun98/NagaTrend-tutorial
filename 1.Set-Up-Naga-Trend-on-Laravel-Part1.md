### Setup environment

The environment variable are used to defined any api key or credentials as well as 
access tokens.

The file is knowns as .env

Firstly, let's change the App url:

```
 APP_URL=http://NagaX.dev
```

Secondly, setup the database connection:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=NagaX
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Note that the first 3 line remain the same and only the forth to sixth line is based on what you have setup in database name and username as well as password. If you set NagaTrend as your database name then use:

```
DB_DATABASE=NagaTrend
```

Lastly, make your database username `root` and password is empty as default.
